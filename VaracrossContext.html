            Students will be able to identify, analyze, and reflect on variation in rhetorical 
            and linguistic patterns, including their own, from a range of contexts (e.g. 
            cultural, digital, workplace, and/or academic).

        <h1>Major Assignment 2 Peer Review</h1>
        <p style="height: 1000px; overflow: auto; font-size: 25px;">
            Very early on in this class ENC 1101 my professor makes it clear that this is much
            different than the language classes we are used to in high school. Unlike what most
            people think and what most people want us to think, there sadly isn't a perfect 
            formula for writng. This is devistating to hear to a computer science major who is getting
            a minor in mathmatics. I feel like I might have known this before this moment,
            you dont need to write a five paragraph essay to your friend asking if they want to
            get lunch with you, but it isn't fun to hear that what you had to work at 
            for most of your life doesn't really help you much in the long run. <br><br>

            When given a prompt to for some sort of literature something there are many different 
            variables that must be considered. Who is the audience? What is the best way to present
            this information I want to spread? How formal or informal is this enviroment? How every
            I argue that not only are there external influences there are internal as well.
            In my class for our Major assignment 2 we were asked to write a multi page essay 
            talking about a community we are appart of and using one of the consepts we learned
            to further the information on it. After writing our first two drafts we would exchange
            papers with a peer and get their opinions on the essay as well and giving them their own.
            Both of my peers were of course given the same assignment, and both chose to write
            their papers on literary sponcers and even with this our essays were different. Reading 
            that last statement you might be thinking well of course we aren't all the same
            person we all would have differnt responces to the same prompt. And you would be
            completely right about that, exactly showing my point. <br><br>

            To the left there is a screen shot of my first peers notes about my second draft. 
            What is highlighted in yellow were the questions I asked him to focus on answering, 
            the blue is his responces. The entire reason peer reviews are able to work in the 
            first place is from the fact that different people see differnt things in literature
            and can help to show you what you may have missed. <br><br>
