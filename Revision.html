        <h1>Major Assignment 1 Revision Plan</h1>
        <p style="height: 300px; overflow: auto; font-size: 25px;">
            sept. 9th: the previous night we had to make our first draft of our first Magor 
            Assignment. While I did think my essay I wrote was find it was lacking in some criteria
            as well as simply needed to be edited and fixed up. We got into partners and we swaped
            papers and started reading what each other wrote. We then explained to eacth other what
            we liked, and what we thought we needed or brainstormed how it could be better. Just
            getting another opinion on something is incredibly important for writing because 
            it allows you to see the thought prossess of the reader. This of course is related with
            revision from the fact that this is criteria for me to re-see, or re-view what I wrote
            and fix it accordingly.
