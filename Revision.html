            If asked which Student Learning Outcome I would say I thought was most useful I would
            say it was Revision. I have dabbled in the arts from drawing, to music, to video game
            prodruction. In all of these I would always show it to some people and ask them for 
            their opinion. I will usualy ask "what is something you like and something you dislike
            about [insert project here]" or at the very least I will ask for what their least
            favorite part is. Constructive criticism is very important to me, I know no matter how
            good I get that I can always be and do better. Someone saying their opinion, more importantly
            their negitive opinion, I can keep that in mind to try my best to avoid or expand on
            that next time. <br><br>

            When it comes to ENC 1101 for each of our Major Assignments we would have two or three days where
            we got feedback from fresh eyes weather that ge a peer or the prossessor himself. Each 
            person in that class has different experiences and writing styles as explained in 
            Varriation Across Contexts tab, so it is useful to hear from them what they think of 
            what I made. <br><br>

            To your right I have a picture of the revision plan for my first Major Assignment. 
            After talking with one of my peers I was tasked to answer some questions about
            what their advice was and what I would do because of it. It was just a way to 
            store our thoughts, while not all tips are nessisarily good, they are always something
            to consider sense it gives you an idea of what a reader could think after reading your
            piece of literature.
