        <p style="height: 1000px; overflow: auto; font-size: 25px;">
            Believe it or not you make choices very common in your day to day life, writing is 
            no different. When making a product you, wheither that is a book, a game, a video,
            an art piece you need to answer some questions. Who is this for? What is the reason
            you are making this? What is this? How long is it going to take? Knowing what questions
            you need to ask you self and what choices you need to make for each genre is important
            to create the best product. <br><br>
            For our major assignment 3 we needed to look back at our two previous major assignments
            and remediate(remake in a new media or mode). Right away I had a desision I had to make,
            I chose to remake my first major assignment, I thought that the assignment had a good 
            consept, but in the end wasn't what I was hopeing it would be. The next improtant 
            choice I had to make was what do I want to remediate this into? I thought it would be smart
            to make it into a video game, I had fun idea where it would be a puzzle game where you have
            to learn this code to solve questions simular to how my dyslexia works. <br><br>
            However this soon resulted in Complications, videos and video games are two very different
            forms of media, mostly based on the level of involvement. When you are watching a video you
            can be doing other things and just have it on in the background or be writng notes along with
            it. But a video game has your entire attention. This is good to help and give information 
            this way, but it also means that the story you are telling turns into more of the players 
            story and not just your own. The other difference is the audience, video games aren't for 
            everyone, and while a video 
            isn't ether nothing is, there is a level of difficultie to a video game that isn't there for 
            a video, because at least the games that I like need a bit of a challenge to be fun.<br><br>
            As of writing this for my e-portolio I have made a
            made is a very alpha version, meaning that the game is very incomplete and has not been playtested
            so it might be a lot easier or a lot harder than I hoped for, however for this remediation project
            i feel like it is at a good enough place to give the player or reader an idea of what the final
            product would be. However I hope to work on this project more because I did have fun with making
            this game and think it would be interesting to go farther with it.
