            The creation of genres are important for the prosute of goals. We learn about discource
            communities in this class, in sort a group of people with a common goal. One of the
            nessisary elements to a discource communitie is the act of having genres to convay information
            to fearther their goal. when it comes to the process of writing these genres it is important
            to undertstand the different variables in the product you are creating.<br><br>
            We learn in this course that writing isn't prescriptive, essesntaly that 
            there isn't some function that you plug in some information into and get the perfect essay.
            the 5 paragraph essay you do in school are examples of this prescriptive writng style, or
            at least the attept at it, even though not all essays should be wrote in that format, and
            very few even do. Writing in instead descriptive. To your right is a screen shot of my 
            third writing journal, it was on this topic about the difference bettween prescriptive and
            descriptive writing. <br><br>
            I talk about how an important variable in my writing commpared to others writing is that
            well I am the one writing it. The way I speak is much different compared to how some one else
            speaks and so the way I give information is slightly different even if I am using the same 
            facts and resources as someone else. So as a result my process of writng should sound like it
            it something from my voice. However I need to combine that with the knowlage of who I am speeking
            to. A message from me to my friend over text should be different than a email to my boss.
