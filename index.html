            My name is Miles Adkins, I'm Computer Science major at Univercity of
            Central Florida. When tasked to make a website to work as a portfolio for my projects
            in my ENC 1101 class while I could have
            used a website maker app, I thought I might as well challenge my self and make my first
            website by hand using only HTML and CSS.

            I consider myself a “Math Guy”, so when it came to English classes in high school,
             it was always a struggle or just boring to me. Going into ENC 1101 I was expecting a 
             very similar experience, however right out of the gate my assumption was proven wrong. 
             Very quickly what we learned flipped writing classes on their head, I learned that 
             writing was descriptive not prescriptive, that it is shaped by not only the person 
             writing, but what it was that they were writing, and who they were writing for. This 
             website you are reading this on can be considered a portfolio of some of my assignments, 
             including a video on literacy narrative, and essay analysis on literacy practice and 
             even a remediation project, as well as a refection of each of them. Below is a short 
             overview of each of the our Student Learning Objectives(SLOs) that drove our course. <br><br> 
            <b>Writing Processes & Adaptations</b><br>
            If you didn’t get this from the name of this SLO, writing is a process, there isn’t a 
            single formula for how to write something good, sadly. As stated before when you are 
            writing there are many different factors that manipulate what is being written and how 
            it is being written. In my remediation project I needed to convert on of my previous 
            assignments into some new genre, off the bat forcing us students to build something 
            that was different. We not only had to come up with a new type of literacy but also 
            try and adapt our previous piece into this new genre without losing the meaning of 
            the piece. <br><br> 
            <b>Multiple Literacies & Goal Setting</b><br>
            This course required students to not only write, we learned that literacy is not 
            soully alphabetic text. We learned to except and lean into multimodality in our 
            literature, whether that is video, audio, pictures, text, it helps to bring the 
            reader in and allows them to better follow what you are conveying. In my assignment 
            about literacy narrative, we had to use multimodality I was originally going to 
            write an essay using alphabetic text, but later I was informed that the information 
            might be better in a video format sense the way I write has a lot of jokes and sarcasm 
            that might be lost in writing. <br><br>
            <b>Variation across Contexts</b> <br>
            This SLO was sort of the bread and butter of the course. No one writes in the same way, 
            even as I have said the same person will write different ways for different reasons. In 
            this course we went farther, we brought up code meshing which is bringing in your 
            cultural background into your writing, really the goal of this SLO is to allow us to 
            understand that there are different ways of writing and to embrace that difference. <br><br>
            <b>Decision Making & Production</b> <br>
            This goes without saying but for every project we had we needed to make some sort of 
            decision. What genre are you working with, who is the audience, what is the limitations 
            of the genre, what modes you can use in this genre. The remediation project was filled 
            with choices, which may have resulted in unseen difficulties. I chose to turn my first 
            assignment into a video game, as you can see I like to involve my major into my work. 
            The video game genre is very different from a video, mainly because you aren’t telling 
            the reader the story, the reader is experiencing the story. In my opinion this can 
            engage your reader at least more than a book, however I had to make choices on what to 
            remove from the video to make the game more “game like”. The production part of this 
            SLO is mostly the acting part of making a decision and acting on it. <br><br>
            <b>Writing and Power</b> <br>
            This course allowed me to find the power behind my words, at least a bit. When I am 
            writing a essay on The Great Gatsby I’m not very invested on the symbolism of Gatsbys 
            car showing the coolness and calmness of the character turning into panic. However, 
            when I am writing an essay about a group of friends I am in that I play tabletop games 
            with like I did for my analysis of a literacy group assignment, it is more personal and 
            in turn the way I write is stronger. Writing and power go hand in hand and being able 
            to put your heart behind your words has always been important. <br><br> 
            <b>Revision</b> <br>
            In this class the revision process was not only highlighted, accented. I always knew 
            that getting feedback on any product you are working on is important but this class 
            magnified that. Every major assignment we had at least one peer review and we would 
            also get feedback from the professor himself. My peer who reviewed my first major 
            assignment was the one who recommended me to turn my essay into a video, looking back 
            on it, it might have been a bit late to completely change genres, but the feedback 
            was key to the final product and made it more interesting in the end.
