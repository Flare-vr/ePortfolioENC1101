            I find the study of ancient civalizations to be a very interesting thing, and as a result
            this specific Student Learning Outcome is very intreaging to me. Language by nature has power,
            we as humans need it to comunicate and spread information. We as humans are social creatures, 
            we like to be around other people for the most part.
            Even introverts like me like to be apart of some communities, to some sense, from a club,
            to a group of people who you play games with, to just having a people to talk to at dinner.
            While that makes us struggle a bit when on the interenet, this is why we like to find people who we enjoy
            being around and shair common goals and interests. <br><br>

            Our second major assignment had to deal with communitys, we had to write on one that we were
            appart of and link it back to something we learned about in our studies, the one that I chose 
            to work on was discource communities. To explain it simply a discourse communitie is a specific
            type of communitie where as a whole there is a public goal that the group is working for. There
            is more to it like requiring a set number of expert members, mediums of communication, genres.
            Some examples of these would be groups like a volonteer goup trying to clean up a beach, a 
            group of people who play a video game, or in my case a massive Dungeons and Dragons game. <br><br>

            To your the right there is my article talking about everything more in depth but to summarize
            I play in a game called the Embers of Valor, its a bit different style of game commpared to most.
            I used it as an example of a discource community, I go more in depth in the article. We also needed
            2 additional files that give examples of our community that we were talking on. In the article 
            I talk about Melzer and use his article on discource communities as a outline for my own. discourse
            communities as a consept revolve arount this central goal, and a key part of it is the use of 
            language and literature to get results of your goal. One other important part is the indiviual aspect.
            It is of course a group thing, but if you are in a community that you are proud to be appart of add 
            are invested in the goal then you could feel the power in your words as an indiviual.
